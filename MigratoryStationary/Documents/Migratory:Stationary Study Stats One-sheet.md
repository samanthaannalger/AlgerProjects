### Experiment 1: Migratory vs Stationary

* **DWV Load** (repeated measures ANOVA) 
  * Treatment = (F(1,1) = 0.004,  p = 0.952)
  * Treatment:Time =  (F(1,1) = 0.159, p = 0.691) 
* **DWV Prevalence** (generalized linear model) 
  * Treatment =  (${\chi}_1$ = 0.0670, p = 0.7958)
  * Treatment:Time = (${\chi}_1$ = 0.0235 , p = 0.8781)
* **BQCV Load** (repeated measures ANOVA) 
  * Treatment = (F(1,1) = 16.49,  p = 0.000323) ******
  * Treatment:Time =  (F(1,1) = 2.229, p = 0.14) 
* **Varroa Load** (repeated measures ANOVA)
  * Treatment = (F(1,1) = 1.562,  p = 0.22)
  * Treatment:Time =  (F(1,1) = 7.903 , p = 0.0066) ******
* **Frames of Bees** (repeated measures ANOVA)
  * Treatment = (F(1,1) = 3.939,  p = 0.0567)
  * Treatment:Time =  (F(1,1) = 5.497, p = 0.0223) ****** 
* **Brood Pattern** (repeated measures ANOVA)
  * Treatment = (F(1,1) =  1.722,  p = 0.199)
  * Treatment:Time =  (F(1,1) = 1.105, p = 0.297)

### Experiment 2: Exposed vs Stationary (control) 

* **DWV Load** (repeated measures ANOVA) 
  - Treatment = (F(1,1) = 2.056  ,  p = 0.162)
  - Treatment:Time =  (F(1,1) = 9.229, p = 0.0049)****** 
* **DWV Prevalence** (generalized linear model) 
  - Treatment =  (${\chi}_1$ = 0.0251 , p = 0.874164)
  - Treatment:Time = (${\chi}_1$ = 4.9447, p = 0.026171) ******
* **BQCV Load** (repeated measures ANOVA) 
  - Treatment = (F(1,1) = 0.045,  p = 0.834)
  - Treatment:Time =  (F(1,1) = 0.156, p = 0.696) 
* **Varroa Load** (repeated measures ANOVA)
  - Treatment = (F(1,1) = 0.005,  p = 0.943)
  - Treatment:Time =  (F(1,1) = 0.268, p = 0.60858)
* **Frames of Bees** (repeated measures ANOVA)
  - Treatment = (F(1,1) = 2.068,  p = 0.16112)
  - Treatment:Time =  (F(1,1) = 8.903, p = 0.00573) ****** 
* **Brood Pattern** (repeated measures ANOVA)
  - Treatment = (F(1,1) = 0.069,  p = 0.795)
  - Treatment:Time =  (F(1,1) = 0.128, p = 0.723)
