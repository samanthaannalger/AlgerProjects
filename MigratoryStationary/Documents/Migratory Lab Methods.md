### Migratory Bee Study Methods

Mite Counts:

* We transferred about 300 bees from each ethanol sample into the glass jar with the screen attached. We shook the jar over a white tray for 45 seconds until all mites fell out of the sample. We counted and recorded the mites/300 bees. Greer Sargeant

Nosema sample preparation and spore counts:

* We transferred 100 bees into a plastic bag. We crushed the bag with a rolling pin for 90 sec. Next, we added 1 mL of water per bee (100 mL)  and allowed the bag to settle for 45 seconds. We transferred about 1.5 mL of the water from the bag, pulling from the water surface. Greer Sargeant
* From each sample, 10 mL from the top third of the vial is loaded onto a hemoecytomer and Nosema spores are viewed under 40X magnification and counted according to XX protocols.   Kendall Eppley

#### Honeybee RNA Extraction Protocol Using E.Z.N.A. Plant RNA Standard Protocol

##### 2017-03-04

**Homogenzation:**

1) Count 50 honeybees and put into extraction bag.

2) Place disposable extraction bag in liquid Nitrogen to flash freeze the bees.

3) Use pestle on outside of bag to homogenize the honeybees for ~30 sec. Carefully at first to not break bag 		open. 

3) Add 10 mL of GITC of buffer into extraction bag (200 ul GITC solution per bee).

4) Homogenize outside of bag with pestle for 2 minutes.

**Make Crude Extraction:**

5) Transfer 1 mL from bag to a 1.5 mL vial to make a crude extraction.

**Begin RNA Extraction**

6) Label 1.5 vials for each sample to be processed

7) Add 500 ul RB Buffer (w/ Beta Mercaptoethanol)  to each vial

8) Transfer 100 ul of crude extraction made in step 5 into the vial containing RB Buffer

**Continue with EZNA Protocols: "Plant RNA Standard Protocol"-Step 4:**

1. Insert a Homogenizer Column into a 2 mL Collection Tube.
2. Transfer the lysate to a Homogenizer Column.
3. Centrifuge at 14,000 x g for 5 minutes at room temperature.
4. Transfer cleared lysate to a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Do not disturb or
   transfer any of the insoluble pellet. Measure the volume of the lysate.
5. Add 1 volume 70% ethanol. Vortex at maximum speed for 20 seconds. A precipitate
   may form at this point; it will not interfere with DNA isolation. Passing the mixture
   through a needle using a syringe or by pipetting up and down 10-15 times may break
   up the precipitates.
6. Insert a HiBind® RNA Mini Column into a 2 mL Collection Tube.
7. Transfer 700 µL sample, including any precipitates that may have formed, to the
   HiBind® RNA Mini Column.
8. Centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 1 minute at room temperature.
9. Discard filtrate and reuse the collection tube.
10. Repeat Steps 10-12 until all of the sample has been transferred to the column.


1. Add 500 μL RNA Wash Buffer I.
2. Centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 30 seconds.
3. Discard the filtrate and the collection tube.
4. Transfer the HiBind® RNA Mini Column to a new 2 mL Collection Tube.
5. Add 700 μL RNA Wash Buffer II.
   Note: RNA Wash Buffer II must be diluted with ethanol before use. Please see Page 6
   for instructions.
6. Centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 30 seconds.
7. Discard the filtrate and reuse collection tube.
8. Add 500 μL RNA Wash Buffer II.
9. Centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 30 seconds.
10. Discard the filtrate and reuse collection tube.
11. Centrifuge the empty HiBind® RNA Mini Column at maximum speed for 2 minutes to
    dry the column.
    Note: This step is critical for removal of trace ethanol that may interfere with
    downstream applications.
12. Transfer the HiBind® RNA Mini Column to a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.
13. Add 50 ul RNAse free Water.
    Note: Make sure to add water directly onto the HiBind® RNA Mini Column matrix.
14. Centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 minute and store eluted RNA at -70°C.
