**Virus detection in saliva and feces of honey bees.**

**Results from previous plant transmission experiment**

|                    | DWV detected | BQCV detected |
| ------------------ | ------------ | ------------- |
| white clover       | X            | X             |
| red clover         | X            | X             |
| birds foot trefoil |              | X             |



**Hypotheses for upcoming work**

|      | Transmitted by Saliva | Transmitted by Feces |
| ---- | --------------------- | -------------------- |
| BQCV | +                     | +                    |
| DWV  | -                     | +                    |



|                   | Transmitted to flower by Saliva | Transmitted to flower by Feces |

Viruses involved: DWV, BQCV

**METHODS:**

1. Identify 3-5 colonies to test (My two colonies, Chas colony, Palmer colony)
2. collect 15 workers from each colony
3. to collect feces, place each worker individually in clear petri dish for 30 minutes, collect 20-25 ul per bee
4. for each bee, dissect out the hypogeal and salivary glands
5. Rinse tissues once with 1 X PBS and twice in nuclease free water, store on -80, Clean forceps with 10% bleach and 70% ethanol between dissections.
6. Pool together the tissues and feces from each colony? Or test individually? Maybe test some individuals and test their pollen loads as well.  
7. Test each tissue and feces for two viruses

Methods for testing different tissues for viruses

Tested tissue (containing salivary glands) and did not find DWV. Claimed that DWV is not transmitted by 				salivary glands but more likely through feces.

Function of different glands for feeding- will help to determine which glands are involved in feeding on flowers vs. functions within the hive such as royal jelly production.
