### Bumble Bee Extraction Protocol (Overwintering Queens)

#### 12-4-17

**Before beginning**:

Make sure there is liquid nitrogen and enough of each reagent (RLT buffer/mercap, 70% ethanol(different from cleaning ethanol), BufferRW1, Buffer RPE, RNase-free water). When in doubt- make more! (see instructions below).

**Setup:**

1. Choose specimens to be processed. (When selecting # of specimen note that small centrifuge has 18 spots- 1 will be for control.) 

2. Place specimen on liquid nitrogen (wear proper protective gear)

3. Write in lab notebook:

   ​a.    Procedure to be done

   ​b.    Date

   c.     Headings for lab ID

   d.    name(s) of individuals doing extractions

   e.    Get the following materials ready: 

- Pestles- take pestles soaking in 10% bleach and rinse with DI water and then ethanol- set to dry. Clean 1 pestle per specimen plus 1-2 more to prepare for error. **If pestle is touched/dropped at any point get new pestle soaking in bleach and follow procedure** 
- Buffer RLT (with B-mercaptoethanol) **Make sure <1 mo. old**
- 1000 ul pippette and tips
- Labeled 1.5 vials with lab ID #(2 for each specimen) plus one for a negative control.
- Labeled 0.5 vials with lab ID (for Nosema samples)
- 2 pairs of small forceps, Kimtech wipes, large forceps, timer.
- 2 small beakers labeled w/ 10% bleach and 70% ethanol (use DI water when dilutingbleach and ethanol).
- Clean lab bench area with 10% bleach and ethanol.

**SPECIMEN DISECECTION AND HOMOGENIZING HEADS** 

1. label 1.5 mL vials and fill one set with 600 uL of RLT-B-mercaptoethanol.
2. Place bee on Kimtech
3. Using disinfected forceps, dissect the head from the thorax. Place body without head back into vial and on liquid nitrogen. 
4. Place the head into a 1.5 tube with the buffer and set timer for 2 minutes. (Soak forceps in bleach and use bottle to clean with ethanol between bee samples).  
5. Homogenize with pestle for 2 minutes.
6. Put sample in refrigerator.
7. Repeat for all specimens.

**PREPARING BEE GUTS AND MAKING NOSEMA SAMPLES**

1. label a 0.5 ml vial for each specimen (for nosema samples)
2. For guts: use pestle to homogenize each vial containing guts plus GITC buffer for 1 minute
3. Vortex each vial containing the gut and GITC buffer for 5-10 seconds, let sit for 30-45 sec. 
4. Transfer 50 uL from the top third of the gut/GITC vial into the new labeled 0.5 ml vials (for nosema samples) 
5. Put nosema samples in the labeled box in the Brody Lab freezer.

**TO CREATE CRUDE EXTRACTIONS:**

1. Centrifuge both the gut and head samples for 3 minutes on max speed. Before continuing, sample should be brought to room temperature.
2. Transfer 500 ul of head homogenize and 100 ul from gut homogenize into new 1.5 tube.
3. Add 600 ul of 70% ethanol to each vial, mix 5-6 times, and using the same pipette tip, transfer 600 ul into labeled spin columns.
4. Create a negative control here (550 ul RLT buffer + 550 ul ethanol). 
5. Put homogenized bee back on ice and set aside to be placed in freezer.

**RNA ISOLATION (fromQiagen)**

1. Centrifuge spin columns for **1 minute** at 8,000 then discard flow-through into small beaker.
2. Add **700ul of Buffer RW1** to spin column, centrifuge for **1 min** at 8,000 and discard flow-through into small beaker.
3. Add **500ul Buffer RPE** to spin column, centrifuge for **1 min** at 8,000 and discard flow-through into small beaker.
4. Add **500ul Buffer RPE** to spin column, centrifuge for **2 min** at 8,000 and discard flow-through into small beaker. Discardbeaker contents down sink.
5. Transfer spin columns into new 2ml tubes and spin at 8,000 for **1 min**. Discard old 2ml tubes.
6. Assemble new 1.5ml tubes and cut off lids.Transfer spin columns to 1.5ml tubes.
7. Add 50ul of RNase-free water directly to the spin column membrane without touching the membrane. **Centrifuge for 1 min** at 8,000. Do NOT discard flow-through.
8. Label 0.5ml tubes with corresponding lab ID #s. 
9. Pipette flow through from 1.5ml tubes into corresponding **0.5ml tubes** and immediately place on ice. Discard spin columns and their tubes.
10. Take 0.5ml tubes up to nanodrop.
