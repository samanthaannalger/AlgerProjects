### Bumble Bee Extraction Standard Protocol

#### 2-11-17

**Before beginning**:

Make sure there is liquid nitrogen and enough of each reagent (RLT buffer/mercap, 70% ethanol(different from cleaning ethanol), BufferRW1, Buffer RPE, RNase-free water). When in doubt- make more! (see instructions below).

**Setup:**

1. Choose specimen to be processed. (When selecting # of specimen note that small centrifuge has 18 spots- 1 will be for control.) 

2. Place specimen on liquid nitrogen (wear proper protective gear)

3. Write in lab notebook:

   ​a.    Procedure to be done

   ​b.    Date

   ​c.     Headings for lab ID, field ID, etc.

   d.    name(s) of individuals doing extractions

   e.    Get the following materials ready: 

* Pestles- take pestles soaking in 10% bleach and rinse with DI water andthen ethanol- set to dry. Clean 1 pestle per specimen plus 1-2 more to preparefor error. *If pestle is touched/dropped at any point get new pestle soakingin bleach and follow procedure. 
* Buffer RLT (with B-mercaptoethanol) **Make sure <1 mo. old**
* Labeled 1.5 tubes with lab ID #(2 for each specimen) plus one for a negative control.
* 2 pairs of small forceps, Kimtech wipes, large forceps, timer.
* 2 small beakers labeled w/ 10% bleach and 70% ethanol (use DI water when dilutingbleach and ethanol).
* Clean lab bench area with 10% bleach and ethanol.   

_______

**PREPARING SPECIMENS AND HOMOGENIZING TO CREATE CRUDE EXTRACTIONS:**

1.    Place bee on Kimtech, record site ID, doublecheck species and gender of the bee.

2.    Using disinfected forceps, dissect the abdomen from the thorax. Place body without abdomen back into vial and on liquidnitrogen. 


3. Place the bee abdomen into a 1.5 tube and set timer for 2 minutes. (Soak forceps in bleach and use bottle to clean with ethanol between bee samples).  
4. Immediately add 600ul Buffer RLT-B-mercaptoethanol to tube
5. Homogenize with pestle for 2 minutes.
6. Put sample in refrigerator.
7. Repeat for all specimens.
8. Centrifuge for 3 minutes to push bee specimen tobottom of tube. Before continuing, sample should be brought to room temperature.



**BEGINNING RNAISOLATION (Making Crude Extraction)**

1.    Fill second set of 1.5 tubes with 550 ul of 70% ethanol.
2.    Pipette out 550ul of bee juice from the homogenized sample into the corresponding 1.5 tube containing 70% ethanol. 
3.    Create a negative control here (550 ul RLT buffer + 550 ul ethanol). 
4.    Put homogenized bee back on ice and set aside to be placed in freezer.



**RNA ISOLATION (fromQiagen)**

1.    Label RNeasy spin column tubes for each specimen.
2.    Use pipette to mix bee, buffer, and ethanol solution (crude extraction) 5-6 times before drawing up 700ul and moving into corresponding spin column.
3.    Place crude extraction back on ice to be placed in freezer. 
4.    Centrifuge spin columns for 1 minute at high speed then discard flow-through into small beaker.
5.    Add 700ul of Buffer RW1 to spin column, centrifuge for 1 min at high speed and discard flow-through into small beaker.
6.    Add 500ul Buffer RPE to spin column, centrifuge for 1 min at high speed and discard flow-through into small beaker.
7.    Add 500ul Buffer RPE to spin column, centrifuge for 2 min at high speed and discard flow-through into small beaker. Discardbeaker contents down sink.
8.    Transfer spin columns into new 2ml tubes and spin at high speed for 1 min. Discard old 2ml tubes.
9.    Assemble new 1.5ml tubes and cut off lids.Transfer spin columns to 1.5ml tubes.
10.    Add 50ul of RNase-free water directly to the spin column membrane without touching the membrane. Centrifuge for 1 min. Do NOT discard flow-through.
11.    Label 0.5ml tubes with corresponding lab ID #s. 
12.    Pipette flow through from 1.5ml tubes into corresponding 0.5ml tubes and immediately place on ice. Discard spin columns and their tubes.
13.    Take 0.5ml tubes up to nanodrop.
