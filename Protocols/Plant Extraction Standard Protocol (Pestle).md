### Plant Extraction Standard Protocol (Pestles)

#### 10-17-17

**Before beginning**:

Make sure there is liquid nitrogen and enough of each reagent (GITC buffer, RLT buffer/mercap, 70% ethanol (different from cleaning ethanol), BufferRW1, Buffer RPE, RNase-free water). When in doubt- make more! (see instructions below).

**Setup:**

1. Choose plant specimen to be processed. (When selecting # of specimen note that small centrifuge has 18 spots- 1 will be for control.) 
2. Place on liquid nitrogen (wear proper protective gear)


1. Write in lab notebook:

   ​a.    Procedure to be done

   ​b.    Date

   ​c.     Headings for lab ID, field ID, etc.

   ​d.    name(s) of individuals doing extractions

2. Get the following materials ready:

- Clean lab bench with 10% bleach and enthanol
- scale, kim wipes, 2 small beakers labeled w/ 10% bleach and 70% ethanol (use DI water when diluting bleach and ethanol)
- clean pestles
- coolers with liquid nitrogen (for homogenization)
- 1000 ul pipette and tips
- Labeled 1.5 tubes with lab ID #(2 for each specimen) plus one for a negative control.
- 2 pairs of small forceps, Kimtech wipes, large forceps, timer.

**PREPARING SPECIMENSAND HOMOGENIZING TO CREATE CRUDE EXTRACTIONS:**

1. Fill one set of 1.5 ml. vials with 600 ml of RLT buffer/mercap.
2. Using a pestle, in the blue field vial, crush the flower tissue into a powder. Keep the sample frozen on liquid nitrogen and do not allow to thaw.
3. Transfer up to 100 mg (.1 g) of ground flower tissue to the corresponding 1.5 ml. vial with buffer. Using the same pestle, continue to grind the flower tissue into the buffer for 1 min. Place the vial in fridge.
4. Note sample name in lab notebook and mark the top of the vial with the lab ID. If applicable, return rest of plant material back into the cooler with liquid nitrogen. 
5. Repeat for all specimens.
6. Centrifuge for 7 minutes to push flower powder to bottom of tube. Before continuing, sample should be brought to room temperature.

**BEGINNING RNAISOLATION (Making Crude Extraction)**

1. Transfer 400 ul of plant homogenite/RLT buffer to the new 1.5 ml vial
2. Add 400ul of 70% ethanol to each. Use pipette to to mix 5-6 times before drawing up 700ul and moving into corresponding spin column.
3. Create a negative control here (400 ul RLT buffer + 400 ul ethanol). 
4. Put crude extraction back on ice and set aside to be placed in freezer.

**RNA ISOLATION (from Qiagen)** 

1. Centrifuge spin columns for 1 minute at high speed then discard flow-through into small beaker.
2. Add 700ul of Buffer RW1 to spin column, centrifuge for 1 min at high speed and discard flow-through into small beaker.
3. Add 500ul Buffer RPE to spin column, centrifuge for 1 min at high speed and discard flow-through into small beaker.
4. Add 500ul Buffer RPE to spin column, centrifuge for 2 min at high speed and discard flow-through into small beaker. Discardbeaker contents down sink.
5. Transfer spin columns into new 2ml tubes and spin at high speed for 1 min. Discard old 2ml tubes.
6. Assemble new 1.5ml tubes and cut off lids.Transfer spin columns to 1.5ml tubes.
7. Add 50ul of RNase-free water directly to the spin column membrane without touching the membrane. Centrifuge for 1 min. Do NOT discard flow-through.
8. Label 0.2ml strip tubes with corresponding lab ID #s. 
9. Pipette flow through from 1.5 ml tubes into corresponding 0.2ml strip tubes and immediately place on ice. Discard spin columns and their tubes.
10. Take 0.2ml strip tubes up to nanodrop.
