### Plant Extraction Standard Protocol (Extraction Bag)

#### 2-11-17

**Before beginning**:

Make sure there is liquid nitrogen and enough of each reagent (GITC buffer, RLT buffer/mercap, 70% ethanol (different from cleaning ethanol), BufferRW1, Buffer RPE, RNase-free water). When in doubt- make more! (see instructions below).

**Setup:**

1. Choose plant specimen to be processed. (When selecting # of specimen note that small centrifuge has 18 spots- 1 will be for control.) 
2. Place on liquid nitrogen (wear proper protective gear)


1. Write in lab notebook:

   ​a.    Procedure to be done

   ​b.    Date

   ​c.     Headings for lab ID, field ID, etc.

   ​d.    name(s) of individuals doing extractions

2. Get the following materials ready:

- Clean lab bench with 10% bleach and enthanol
- scale, weigh boats, kim wipes, 2 small beakers labeled w/ 10% bleach and 70% ethanol (use DI water when diluting bleach and ethanol).
- Labeled extraction bags
- Canister with liquid Nitrogen
- GITC Buffer 
- 1000 ul pipette and tips
- Labeled 1.5 tubes with lab ID #(2 for each specimen) plus one for a negative control.
- 2 pairs of small forceps, Kimtech wipes, large forceps, timer.

**PREPARING SPECIMENSAND HOMOGENIZING TO CREATE CRUDE EXTRACTIONS:**

1. Using disinfected forceps, weigh out flower material (use fresh looking flowers). If using variable amounts of flower material, use excel sheet to determine the amount of GITC buffer to add. (3mL per 1.5 grams). Transfer flower material to labeled extraction bag. Write GITC buffer amount on bag. Place bag into the canister of liquid nitrogen. 
2. Note sample name in lab notebook and mark the top of the vial with the lab ID. If applicable, return rest of plant material back into the cooler with liquid nitrogen. 
3. After flash freezing, use a pestle on outside of extraction bag to crush plant sample into powder (~30 sec.).
4. Add specified amount of GITC buffer to the extraction bag and homogenize using pestle on outside of bag for 2.5 minutes.
5. Use pippette to extract as much liquid as possible and place into 1.5 ml vial.
6. Put vial on ice and throw away extraction bag.
7. Repeat for all specimens.
8. Centrifuge for 3 minutes to push specimen to bottom of tube. Before continuing, sample should be brought to room temperature.



**BEGINNING RNAISOLATION (Making Crude Extraction)**

1. Label spin columns. Fill second set of 1.5 vial with 500 ul of Buffer RLT- B-mercaptoethanol (crude extraction).
2. Add 200 ul of plant homogenite/GITC buffer to corresponding 1.5 vial containing RLT buffer buffer (crude extraction).
3. Using a single pipette tip per sample, add 700ul of 70% ethanol to each crude extraction. Use pipette to to mix 5-6 times before drawing up 700ul and moving intocorresponding spin column.
4. Create a negative control here (200 ul GITC, 500 ul RLT buffer + 700 ul ethanol). 
5. Put crude extraction back on ice and set aside to be placed in freezer.

**RNA ISOLATION (from Qiagen)** 

1. Centrifuge spin columns for 1 minute at high speed then discard flow-through into small beaker.
2. Add 700ul of Buffer RW1 to spin column, centrifuge for 1 min at high speed and discard flow-through into small beaker.
3. Add 500ul Buffer RPE to spin column, centrifuge for 1 min at high speed and discard flow-through into small beaker.
4. Add 500ul Buffer RPE to spin column, centrifuge for 2 min at high speed and discard flow-through into small beaker. Discardbeaker contents down sink.
5. Transfer spin columns into new 2ml tubes and spin at high speed for 1 min. Discard old 2ml tubes.
6. Assemble new 1.5ml tubes and cut off lids.Transfer spin columns to 1.5ml tubes.
7. Add 50ul of RNase-free water directly to the spin column membrane without touching the membrane. Centrifuge for 1 min. Do NOT discard flow-through.
8. Label 0.5ml tubes with corresponding lab ID #s. 
9. Pipette flow through from 1.5ml tubes into corresponding 0.5ml tubes and immediately place on ice. Discard spin columns and their tubes.
10. Take 0.5ml tubes up to nanodrop.
