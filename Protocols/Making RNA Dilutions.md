### Making RNA Dilutions

#### 2-23-17

#### Materials needed:

* Extracted RNA (non diluted)
* RNA dilution worksheet
* Labeled 0.5 ml vials (one for each RNA extraction, put a "d" on each vial to differentiate the diluted RNA from the extracted RNA)

#### Protocol:

1. Pull RNA extractions to be diluted from the freezer and place on ice
2. Thaw extractions by leaving on ice. You can briefly keep the vial between your fingers to help thaw but put back on ice as soon as possible
3. Once thawed, vortex for 2-3 secounds and spin down
4. Label one 0.5 ml vial for each RNA extraction. Put the ID# on each and the letter "D" (for dilution).
5. Using the RNA dilution worksheet, add the correct amount of water to each vial.
6. Again using the RNA dilution worksheet, add the correct amount of extracted RNA to each vial. **Keep RNA extractions on ice during this process. Immediately place diluted RNA vials on ice once RNA is added.**
7. Return diluted RNA and RNA extractions back in the freezer in their respective boxes. 
8. Tape the RNA dilution worksheet into the lab notebook. Make an entry in the notebook with the date, a sentence of which samples were diluted, and your name.
