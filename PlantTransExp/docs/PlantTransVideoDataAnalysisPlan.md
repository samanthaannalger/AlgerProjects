Plant Transmission Experiment

Video Data

Variables:

Number of visits to each flower

Average time spent on flowers- does this differ by species?





Questions:

Does number of visits and/or time spent on flowers increase the likelihood of detecting viruses on the plants?

What about AMOUNT of virus on each plant sample? Is there a way to quantify virus particles on plants?

It appears that the number of visitations does not make a difference for BQCV- time SPENT on flower is more important. Opposite is true for DWV. It looks like time spent does not make a different (BFT does not have DWV on it) but the flowers most often visited have DWV detected.

Updated hypothesis:

|      | Transmitted by Saliva | Transmitted by Feces |
| ---- | --------------------- | -------------------- |
| BQCV | -                     | +                    |
| DWV  | +                     | -                    |

Figures: 

Separate figures for virus detection on plants for:

* acute treatment groups.
* diversity
* chronic exposure (include in acute?)

I tested virus load in salivary glads and abdomens, (11/14/2017). Take a look at results. Are the virus loads consistent with the above predictions?



Slides explaining upcoming experiments:

Use fake flowers to test: 

â€‹	virus inoculum and honey bee flowers. To reduce variability and improve our chances of detecting a signal. We are going to make fake flowers of different shapes and test WHERE honey bees are leaving viruses behind (petals vs. nectaries). To aid in our understanding of how viruses are being shed.
