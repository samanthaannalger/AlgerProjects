Hive loss across the state is around 35% and most losses are due to varroa. Beekeepers did not want mandated registration, so in 1994 the mandate was repealled and the inspection program ended. Jack Peterson's personal opinion is that it is unlikely for the registration mandate to be reinstated because demand and funding is seemlingly nonexistent.
