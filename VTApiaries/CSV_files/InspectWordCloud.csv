There is a need for more inspectors in order to keep up with everything they have to do (Time).

"The general public has taken on ""save the bees"" initiative, but discussion is focused on neonicotinoides and needs to be broadened. Beekeeping hobbyists are not well informed because no mandated registration means no funding for state program or University programs (education)."



Adequately surveying all bees coming into and leaving the state (time).

Beekeepers tend to be reclusive which hinders registration initiative.



Only responsibility is to inspect exports. No inspection program in Kansas.

Making enough time to get around to inspect everyone who needs to be inspected.

Cybil wishes she had more time to teach beekeeping hobbyists. Hobbyists are eager for more mentorship and education.

"Michael Hansen states he is limited in his (time) as State Apiarist due to his many other responsibilities and the absence of an inspection program and funding. He is concerned about the ability of recreational beekeepers to recognize common diseases such as foulbrood. Michigan has an intense need for healthy honeybees because more than 60 of their 300 annual crops require bee pollination. Michigan bees also significantly aid pollination efforts in California, Georgia, Florida, and across the country. For such reasons, Michigan would greatly benefit from an Apiary Inspection Program."
The change in requirements for USDA sampling caused complications in spring 2018. Geographically large state makes it difficult for single inspector to get surveys ( for National HoneyBee Survey and exports) finished-time.





There is only one part-time inspector and only around 2-3 dozen inspections are done every year. The only inspections he has time to conduct are for bees that are being exported out of state.
"Tim is the only inspector, which means he has to prioritize beekeepers to visit. Varroa cause the most damage to colonies in the state."

"Paul Cappy stated that increased cooperation with beekeeper hobbyists (of which there are around 3,000 to 4,000 in NY) is needed in order to maintain bee health across the state. The problem with American foulbrood is increasing and registering beekeeping hobbyists would help control outbreaks."
European foulbrood and a new bacterial situation with varroa keeps the inspectors busy.
