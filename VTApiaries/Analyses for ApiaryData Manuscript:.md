**Analyses for ApiaryData Manuscript:**



Density/Distribution of beekeepers and apiaries… Which counties have the greatest?  **ANOVA**

Distribution of colony losses-  Is there spatial clustering? If so, where are the greatest colony losses? (it appears that losses are higher in counties east of the Green Mountains) **Moran's I/ANOVA**

Distribution of mite monitoring- Where are highest proportions of mite monitors? (it appears that mite monitoring is more common west of the green mountains) **Moran's I/ANOVA**

**Some basic stats/data cleaning needed for the GLM**

Classify beekeepers as organic mitacides vs. synthetic mitacides vs. nothing.

Compute # of beekeepers use 0, 1, 2, 3 + different kinds of mite treatments



What factors best explain colony losses? 
**GLM:**

variables to test: location (county), number of kinds of mite treatments, whether they use synthetic/organic treatments, if they monitor their mite loads…. etc.?
