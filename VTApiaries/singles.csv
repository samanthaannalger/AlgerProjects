David - you should include a comments or notes to inspector section on this if you plan to make us do it annually, thanks. -HK
(brought down from question 5 -- form ran out of room):
(No mite counts performed but following comments): Use screen bottom boards and nuc making for I PM; have a (mostly) isolated treatement-free apiary; Generally use nuc creation to break brood cycle but colonies last summer didn't throw many queen cells as I kept addin gboxes for honey production - Didn't have funds to buy queens for nuc making and thought all was going well - Unfortunately fall drought stoppped brood production early and I went into winter with mostly dd queens, mid size colonies with lots of honey. Drastic weather in winter with hellacious wind storms and ice didn't help. Made new winter wraps which didn't perform as well as TarPaper. All in all, I think they struggles and past tipping poing of mites vs bees. I also believe neigbor on Rte 4 bought sick bees from Maine into town and probably nucs from Webster brought mites in, too this year. - Was a devastating February day to discover only 5 out of 23 had survived. The 5th was gone to Nosema issues by April 6th. I called you to help autopsy but didn't hear a thing - was VERY disappointed in that as well. Still trying to a go of things as a sideliner.
(comments for question 10):
Expert advice and money. I wish I knew how to graft queens - was just building up resources and equipment to get there and ƒ WHAM ƒ back to square one. The only saving grace is the 4 remaining colonies are the best of the 4 strains of genetics I spent all that itme and money on for all these years. Unfortunately, now I have all the equipment and drawn comb for my 2nd Apiary/Nuc Yard plan and not enough Bees and Queens. I also have honey customers this year and hope to find a balance somehow.
